    <p>My name is Michael Jarvis and I am from Wisconsin. I am junior and a physics major in the 4+1 
        get my masters in 5 years.
        program to try and I am also on the cross country and track team here at Lewis along with my sister.
        She is my older sister who is in her first year of grad school at Lewis.

    <h2>What I Hope To Learn</h2>
    <p>The main reason I took this class was to get a basic understanding of coding. With physics,
        it is vital to know how to code. I felt that this would be a
        great way to get my foot into the door of coding to help me out.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
    <p>One of my favorite hobbies is I love to watch and play almost anything sports.
        Growing up, I played almost every sport that I could.
        I was always outside playing playing football during recess or playing basketball 
        and baseball on the weekends. So early on almost everything
        I did involved sports. And it kind of stuck with me. All through middle school and 
        high school, I was in a sport during every season. Now,
        in college, I still am spending a lot of time running cross country and track. I 
        am also a big Packers fan. I grew 30 minutes away from Green
        Bay and grew up watching them every sunday.
